#FAQ
##Bug reporting
* Please report all bugs for the **Character Sheets** on [MPMB GitHub page](https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet/issues). We are not an official bug reporting location currently.
* For reporting bugs **with the scripts themselves**, please direct those to the [safety-orange GitHub page](https://github.com/safety-orange/Imports-for-MPMB-s-Character-Sheet/issues). While /u/safety-orange will help and be involved in discussions on the subreddit, the GitHub is the intended bug reporting location.

##Posting content
Only post code using a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), so that we do not have formatting issues. Keep in mind to do the following:

* Use .js as the file extension - So that GitHub will use proper syntax highlighting.
* Create a Private Gist - This keeps it private, but allows you to post the URL that we can access.
* Include the URL in your post.

##Other Questions

**Q:** Where can I find the SRD content? It's not listed in the sticky!

*A:** Since the SRD content is included by default in the sheets, they are not included in the content tables. To view SRD specific information please visit [MPMB's Github Repo](https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet).

**Q:**  What is the difference between the 'Printer Friendly' and the 'Printer Friendly - Redesign' sheets?

**A:** The 'Printer Friendly' sheet uses elements from the official character sheets. The 'Printer Friendly - Redesign' sheet uses elements and designs that MPMB created himself to avoid any potential copyright issues.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Can I run the sheets on <Operating System>?

**A:** The sheet requires Adobe Acrobat Reader DC run on either Windows or Mac OS in order to work. To get the full list of system specs, please visit the [Adobe Help Page](https://helpx.adobe.com/reader/system-requirements.html) regarding this.

&nbsp;

**Q:** Can I use the sheets on a mobile device?

**A:** Due to the JavaScript required for it to work, the sheet requires a Windows or Mac system with Adobe Acrobat DC. No other software will support the JavaScript automations in the sheet. You can open the PDF with any PDF viewer, even on mobile devices, but you can't use any of the automation. A workaround for this is to create the sheet on your computer and then use the "flatten" button to make some fields read-only. The result can then be used on any device without running the risk of changing something that will break the automation. To change something on the sheet, simply open it again in Adobe Acrobat DC and press the "flatten" button again to make the fields editable again.
