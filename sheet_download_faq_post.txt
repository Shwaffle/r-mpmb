##FAQ
###Bug reporting
* Please report all bugs for the **Character Sheets** on [MPMB GitHub page](https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet/issues). We are not an official bug reporting location currently.
* For reporting bugs **with the scripts themselves**, please direct those to the [safety-orange GitHub page](https://github.com/safety-orange/Imports-for-MPMB-s-Character-Sheet/issues). While /u/safety-orange will help and be involved in discussions on the subreddit, the GitHub is the intended bug reporting location.

###Posting content
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only post code using a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), so that we do not have formatting issues. Keep in mind to do the following:

* Use .js as the file extension - So that GitHub will use proper syntax highlighting.
* Create a Private Gist - This keeps it private, but allows you to post the URL that we can access.
* Include the URL in your post.

###How to import a script
1. Right-click a 'download' link to a .js file, [like from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpmb/comments/7gkmsp), and select "Copy Link Location" (actual wording may differ, depending on your browser/language)
2. Open the PDF and click on the bookmark that reads "Add Extra Materials"
3. Select the option "Import a file with additional material"
4. In the dialogue that appears, click "Add file", and have the "Open File" dialogue of your OS open
5. In the "Open File" dialogue that opens, you can now paste the link that you copied in step 1 and select to open that file
6. Click "Apply changes" in the 'Import files' dialogue in the PDF and the sheet will process the file(s) you added. You will get a pop-up message if it was successful
